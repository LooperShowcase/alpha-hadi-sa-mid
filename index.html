      <h3>
        Cupra (Cupra) is a new brand in the VAG empire, under whose name SEAT
        produces the "charge" of its models. The first model of the new brand
        was the small Ateca SUV, the second the independent model Cupra
        Formentor.

      <h3>
        In 2018, SEAT officially announced the creation of the independent Cupra
        brand with its own logo. They announced at the company that this would
        allow the car to be given “its own soul, its own DNA and its own
        personality.” Now the most powerful and fastest Spanish cars will be
        produced under their own names

      <h3>
        Cupra is an excellent possibility for the Spanish brand to increase its
        popularity, as it will be presented as a “more upscale” model, even
        “higher than Volkswagen.” The new brand model will reach new markets,
        including North America, and thus sales and profits will increase.
